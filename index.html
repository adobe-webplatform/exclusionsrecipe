                <p>Have all ingredients chopped and ready to go. In a deep
                skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. Add all
                vegetables and ginger. Chow (stir-fry) quickly until onion is
                cooked and translucent. Remove to bowl.
                Add 2 tablespoons oil to wok; heat. Add chicken and chow
                until no longer pink on outside (5–7 minutes).
                Mix in separate bowl sauce ingredients, making sure to mix
                cornstarch thoroughly. To chicken in wok, add vegetables and
                sauce mix. Cook over low heat until cornstarch is cooked, about
                7 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve over hot
                cooked white rice.</p>

                <p>Western cultures use sweet and sour sauce in two different
                ways. Dishes can either include the sauce as an ingredient in
                cooking or use the sauce as a pour-over or dipping sauce for
                the meal.</p>
                <p>Chinese restaurants in Western countries commonly serve
                chicken, pork, or shrimp that has been battered and deep-fried,
                then served with a sweet and sour sauce poured over the meat.
                It is also common to find the sweet and sour sauce cooked with
                sliced green peppers, onions and pineapple before it is poured
                over the meat.</p>
                <p>Common in Western sweet and sour sauce is the addition of
                fruits such as pineapple and vegetables such as sweet pepper
                and green onions. Traditional rice vinegar is becoming more
                readily available due to the increase in Asian food stores but
                a mixture of vinegar and dry sherry is often still used in
                sweet and sour dishes. Also common is the use of corn starch as
                thickener for the sauce and tomato ketchup to give a stronger
                red colour to the dish and to add a Western taste. Most
                supermarkets across Europe and America carry a range of
                prepared sweet and sour sauces either for adding to a stir-fry
                or for use as a dipping sauce.</p>
